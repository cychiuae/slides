* Playground
An effort to encourage Oursky Developers to develop or experiment with prototypes. It is basically like a 2-week hackathon.

* What kind of project will be accepted?

- Prototype apps with Skygear
- Research Topics

* Prototype apps with Skygear

- Any developers / geeks related apps
- Draw attentions (go hot on HackerNews)
- Mini-apps / April Fools apps / Mini online services
- You can try to convince a designer to make a design for your idea, but there is no guarantee
- Develop on Skygear
- Launch / deploy after 2 weeks.

* Research Topics

- Machine learning, Augmented Reality, Computer Graphic, Security or any other fields which could be beneficial to future app development.
- PoC with a command line program / simple web interface / library.
- No high level library
- 2 - 3 weeks (before working on the project, it is wise to do some background reading in your own time first)
- Launch/deploy/open source libraries

* Playground meant don't have to be perfect

* Self-managed

* Goal of Playground

- PR & Marketing for Developer / General Public by Fun / Viral
- Demonstrate Skygear
- Team Culture
- Learning

* How to participate?

- Join Slack #playground
- Github Issues Tracker at oursky/playground
  - Idea - Discuss and vote!
  - Ready - Planned for 2 weeks!
  - Scheduled - Confirmed proposal and scheduled by PM
  - WIP

* How to schedule?

- PM will be notified with confirmed proposal
- Target: 12 playground project in first year

* Sample Projects (Prototype apps)

* Prototype apps

- Something like [this](https://txt.fyi/about/) has 655 points on HN

* Prototype apps examples

- 1) Air drop over Internet
    - Fancy the Air Drop interface? Let's send a file via network using the same interaction.

* Prototype apps examples

- 2) Searchshot (submited proposal)
    - Easily find information you captured in a screenshot
    - Display screenshot -> OCR the text -> make them searchable

* Prototype apps examples

- 3) 聲控四驅車
    - An app that takes minimal sets of vocal commands: “Go”, “Turn Left”, “Turn Right”, “Halt”
    - Attach a mini-board (RasPi zero) to control the 四驅車

* Prototype apps examples

- 4) Wearable device to monitor health of the cats
    - Kind of this, don't have actual ideas before I do any research.

* Prototype apps

- More interesting proposals are welcomed.

* Sample Projects (Research Topic)

* Sample Projects (Research Topic)

- Style Transfer
- Deep Dream
- Chatbot
- Interaction between virtual objects and 3D reconstructed scene

* Style Transfer

* What is Style Transfer?

Take two images, and transfer one's style to another

.image playground/deadpool.png _ 800

* How to get started and what to do
- Read and understand Standford CS20 SI's assignemnt guide and lecture note, and/or the original paper
- implmeent the basic function using the deep learning library you choose
- try other model
- improve the performance

* Deep Dream

* What is Deep Dream?

Creating a dream-like hallucinogenic appearance on the input image

.image playground/deepdream.jpg

* How to get started and what to do
- Read and understand the python notebook and/or the original paper 
- implmeent the basic function using the deep learning library you choose
- try other model and/or model that train with different dataset
  - if the model is trained from ImageNet (mainly natural object), the hallucination will be full of animal and plant
  - if the model is trained form NSFW, it will be something like https://open_nsfw.gitlab.io/

* Chatbot
    
* Siri!

    > human
    bot

    > you are a monster!
    i am . . .
    > i'm sorry
    you don ' t need to boy .
    > i'm a girl!
    you done ?
    ==========
    > Did you change your hair?

    > no?
    no i won t .
    > who?
    paul owen .
    > where?
    in a harem .

* How to get started and what to do

- Read and understand Standford CS20 SI's assignemnt guide and lecture note, and/or the original paper
- implmeent the basic function using the deep learning library you choose
- create a chatbot with personality
- use character-level sequence to sequence model for the chatbot
- make a Cantonese chatbot

* Chatbot cont.
Possible result if trained the using dataset extracted from hkgolden

    >human
    bot

    >hihi
    Hi Auntie
    >Do you speak English?
    I go to school by bus
    >乜得你咁九唔搭八㗎
    屌！講呢啲


* Interaction between virtual objects and 3D reconstructed scene
  
* What is it?

Start from 3:49
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quGhaggn3cQ

- work on mobile phone
- let's keep the scene small and statistic
- possible interaction
  - throwing particle to the scene
  - a cloth falling on the scene
  - pour water to a valley-liked scene
  - a car running on the scene

* How to get started
- Scene reconstruction
- Read and implement MobileFusion: http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~mobile/Papers/2015ISMAR_ondruska.pdf
- Object-scene interaction
  - Read course note found in internet
    - https://graphics.ethz.ch/teaching/simulation13/notes.php
    - Ask Jason to get the archive of the course material
